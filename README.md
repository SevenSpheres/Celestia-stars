# Celestia-stars
This repository includes all the star files for [Celestia](https://github.com/CelestiaProject/Celestia).
It exists mainly so that I can keep track of my changes to starnames.dat.
Credit goes to [Luke](https://github.com/LukeCEL) for the files stars.dat, stars.txt, hdxindex.dat, and saoxindex.dat,
and also the file jsdc.stc which replaces charm2.stc.
(His stars.dat file with 2 million stars - [here](https://celestia.space/forum/viewtopic.php?p=142745#p142745) - was too big to upload!)

Even though this is mainly for my own personal use, feedback and pull requests are welcome!
