# Celestia-stars
This repository includes all the star files for [Celestia](https://github.com/CelestiaProject/Celestia).
It exists so that I can keep track of my changes to these files, all of which eventually get added to [CelestiaContent](https://github.com/CelestiaProject/CelestiaContent).
Credit goes to [Andrew Tribick](https://github.com/ajtribick) for the files stars.dat, hdxindex.dat, and saoxindex.dat,
and to [Luke](https://github.com/LukeCEL) for the file jsdc.stc which replaces charm2.stc.

License is CC-BY-SA 4.0 (Andrew Tribick's files) or GPL 2.0 (all other files).

~~Even though this is mainly for my own personal use, feedback and pull requests are welcome!~~
Feedback and PRs should probably be in [CelestiaContent](https://github.com/CelestiaProject/CelestiaContent) now.
