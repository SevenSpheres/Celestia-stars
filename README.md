# Celestia-stars
This repository includes all the star files for [Celestia](https://github.com/CelestiaProject/Celestia).
It exists mainly so that I can keep track of my changes to starnames.dat.
Credit goes to [Andrew Tribick](https://github.com/ajtribick) for the files stars.dat, hdxindex.dat, and saoxindex.dat,
and to [Luke](https://github.com/LukeCEL) for the file jsdc.stc which replaces charm2.stc.

License is CC-BY-SA 4.0 (Andrew Tribick's files) or GPL 2.0 (all other files).

Even though this is mainly for my own personal use, feedback and pull requests are welcome!
